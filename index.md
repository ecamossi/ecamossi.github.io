I am a Computer Scientist with expertise in semantic modelling of information, geospa- tial data management and interoperability, knowledge discovery from spatio-temporal data, spatio-temporal databases and geographical and spatial information systems.
I am scientific assistant at the Science and Technology Organisation - Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE), in La Spezia, Italy, since 2014. 

Before joining CMRE, I have been solution architect for interoperable geographic data infrastructures (September 2013 - June 2014) and post-doctoral researcher on spatio-temporal knowledge discovery (April 2010 - March 2013) at the European Commission Joint Research Centre in Ispra, Italy;  post-doctoral researcher on multi-granular spatio-temporal data modelling at University College Dublin, in Ireland (October 2007- October 2009); post-doctoral researcher on semantic information extraction and modelling at the Italian Research Council (CNR) in Genova, Italy ( March 2005 - July 2007); research assistant on spatio-temporal data modelling at the NATO Undersea Research Centre in La Spezia, Italy (July - October 2007).

I have been awarded a PhD (March 2005) and a MSc (February 2001) in Computer Science, from the University of Milan, in Italy. During my PhD, I studied the modelling of spatio-temporal multi-granularity information.
